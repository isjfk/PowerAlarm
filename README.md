# Power Alarm Clock
Set alarms to repeat by powerful date rules, which no other apps could do the same.

> Recently there are reports that this app did not work in some Android 5.0 devices. I don't own an Android 5.0 device and I don't have time to maintain this app for now. Please find another one if this didn't work for you.

# Power Alarm Clock main features:

1. Define alarm and workday in complex date repeat rules.
  * For example, "last Saturday of every month", "12, 16 and 23 of every month". See details in below section.
2. Combine two or more complex date rules to get more powerful result.
  * For example, "from Monday to Friday of every week", plus "last Saturday of every month", then subtract "date range from 25/12/2012 to 28/12/2012".
3. Disable alarm of single time.
  * For example, you set an alarm to ring at 7:30 every morning. It's possible to just disable the alarm of tomorrow morning, while all other alarms will still went off.
4. Disable alarms of selected date range.
5. Select any music in your device as alarm ringtone.
6. Ringtone & vibrate fade in when alarm went off.
7. Set an alarm to only ring or only vibrate.
8. Very large snooze button (turn on in preference).
9. Lock "Dismiss" and "Snooze" button for 2 seconds after alarm went off to prevent misoperation.
10. Lock "Dismiss" and "Snooze" button when device was in pocket to prevent misoperation.
11. Snooze time is configurable.
12. Show next alarm time and remaining time in status bar for easy access (can be disabled in preference).
13. Snoozed alarm will shown in status bar, you can dismiss it immediately.
14. If you don't response the alarm for sometime, it will automatically snooze for 3 times, then dismiss to save battery power. An notification message will leave in status bar so you know you miss it.
15. Speak alarm's name when rings (turn on in preference, currently only English supported).
