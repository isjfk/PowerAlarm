# Power Alarm Clock main features:

1. Define alarm and workday in complex date repeat rules.
  * For example, "last Saturday of every month", "12, 16 and 23 of every month". See details in below section.
2. Combine two or more complex date rules to get more powerful result.
  * For example, "from Monday to Friday of every week", plus "last Saturday of every month", then subtract "date range from 25/12/2012 to 28/12/2012".
3. Disable alarm of single time.
  * For example, you set an alarm to ring at 7:30 every morning. It's possible to just disable the alarm of tomorrow morning, while all other alarms will still went off.
4. Disable alarms of selected date range.
5. Select any music in your device as alarm ringtone.
